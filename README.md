# Logging Project
Integration of Spring MVC web app with ELK stack

This project was created as а result of а research about new and better ways of logging big amounts of data generated by web applications especially those using log4j as logging tool. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate the capabilities and benefits of using ELK stack as а log storage and log management tool. The web application itself provides a bunch of simple Restful web services providing logging of custom data or random exceptions via Log4J. It also allows logs export to Logstash.
